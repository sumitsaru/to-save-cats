    <p> An estimated 7.6 million animals enter America’s shelters every year. Countless others are taken in by organizations who don’t have brick-and-mortar facilities, and therefore, rely on keeping animals in foster homes until they’re adopted. When shelters are running out of space or have animals who are not faring well in a kennel environment, they often rely on these foster-based rescue organizations to take in animals and help them find adoptive homes. Some shelters also have internal fostering programs where individuals work directly with the shelters to provide temporary homes for animals until they’re adopted. Fostering cats is important because it helps reduce overcrowding in shelters and opens up space for another animal to be saved. It also helps prepare animals for adoption by giving them a chance to live in a home where the can fully express their personality, work to overcome fears, or recover from trauma.</p>
