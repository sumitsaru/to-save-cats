    <title>About To Save Cats</title>
    <img src="img/Picture of Cats.jpg">
    <p> An estimated 7.6 million animals enter America’s shelters every year.</p>
    <p> Countless others are taken in by organizations who don’t have brick-and-mortar facilities, and therefore, rely on keeping animals in foster homes until they’re adopted.</p>
    <p> When shelters are running out of space or have animals who are not faring well in a kennel environment, they often rely on these foster-based rescue organizations to take in animals and help them find adoptive homes.</p>
    <p> Some shelters also have internal fostering programs where individuals work directly with the shelters to provide temporary homes for animals until they’re adopted.</p>
    <p> Fostering cats is important because it helps reduce overcrowding in shelters and opens up space for another animal to be saved.</p>
    <p> It also helps prepare animals for adoption by giving them a chance to live in a home where the can fully express their personality, work to overcome fears, or recover from trauma.</p>
